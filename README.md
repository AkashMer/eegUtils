# eegUtils

Some (extremely) simple helper utilities for plotting EEG data in R. Use with caution.

devtools::install_github('craddm/eegUtils') should install it.

There are currently a few working commands that should be useable - 

* topoplot()
* plot_timecourse()/plot_butterfly() 
* erp_scalp() - thanks to Matti Vuorre!
* interactive_scalp() - a Shiny version of erp_scalp() that allows you to zoom in on specific electrodes.
